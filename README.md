## Quality Indicator using Nodejs, reactjs, and mongodb.
Quality Indicator application for calculating and presenting Quality measurements of a software project.

## Project Duration: August 2017 to October 2017
## Introduction
The Quality Indicator, which measures the firmware quality status during and at the end of the project life cycle, are composed of “DO” data and “END IT” data. Currently, the Project Quality Indicator is documented in Excel. However, the excel version lacks flexibility in maintenance and expandability. In addition, the quality indicator should have the capability to be integrated into the quality state model for future expansion. Therefore, a web-based application that record and present the project quality data is required.
Functional requirement
1.	Create and edit project process information
2.	Calculate project quality indicator
3.	Store the project data in database
4.	Show the current status and history of the quality indicator (ex. Radar diagram and history diagram)
5.	Export data into Excel format

## Methodology
Nodejs as backend, mongodb as database and ReactJS as frontend. 

## Plan and Milestone
- 7/31 - 8/11: Setup the frontend and backend environment, implement the website to create a project.
Milestone: Website to create project and store project meta data
- 8/11 – 8/25: Expand the functional property of the website  
Milestone: Website to edit project process information and calculate project quality indicator, backend API
